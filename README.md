# Audio Emotion Recognition

Audio emotion analysis is a process developed to extract features from audio clips and classify the emotion of the speaker. The data-set chosen is extracted from the The Ryerson Audio Visual Databaseof Emotional Speech and Song ([RAVDESS](https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio)). This project uses many different approaches to classify speech snippets into eight different emotions - *Neutral, Calm, Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgust, Surprised* - after pre-processing the extracted data.

**NOTE** : To replicate the entire project, please ensure that the dataset is downloaded from [RAVDESS](https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio) and placed in the [dataset/ravdess](https://github.com/AryaRajivChaloli/Audio-Emotion-Recognition/tree/master/dataset/ravdess) folder as done with the sample files that are already present in the folder

## Demo

The demo of the proposed model can be visualized in the [DEMO.py](https://github.com/AryaRajivChaloli/Audio-Emotion-Recognition/tree/master/DEMO) folder.

**NOTE** : Just run the [Demo.ipynb](https://github.com/AryaRajivChaloli/Audio-Emotion-Recognition/tree/master/DEMO/Demo.ipynb) file.

## Final Model

The implementation of the final model is present in the [/code/finalModel](https://github.com/AryaRajivChaloli/Audio-Emotion-Recognition/tree/master/code/4_finalModel) folder.
